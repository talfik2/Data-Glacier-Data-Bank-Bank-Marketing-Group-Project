# Data-Glacier-Data-Bank-Bank-Marketing-Group-Project
This branch represents the 4'th step of Data Bank Bank Marketing Group Project in Data Glacier Data Science Internship.
In this branch, M.L. Model that we are going to use in the upcoming steps is built & defined.
In the 4'th step,
* First, our dataset is split into train & test sets by sklearn's `train_test_split`
* As the problem is a classification problem, `TPOTClassifier` is used to define the most optimal model along with it’s best hyperparameters’ and pipeline steps.
* In the end, pipeline that is composed by `StackingEstimator` and `GaussianNB` is defined as the convinient M.L. model for project.
* Step 2,3 & 4's code can be found here.
This step is completed by Tevfik SASTIM.
