This branch Data Bank Bank Marketing Group Project's 7'th step: Model Governance.
Here is the final version of our group's app: https://bankmarketingdatabank.herokuapp.com/

In this step, I governed our model in step 6 with Heroku. During my deployment, I also applied my git and sys knowledged. 
* `model.pkl` points out my model that is deployed by Flask
* `model.py` is the py version of `model.pkl`
* `requirements.txt` is the requirements text file for Heroku.
* `Procfile` is the file that tells Heroku what to do.
* `temp.py` points out the temp file for Flask Deployment
* `index.html` points out the html code for the Model Deployment on Flask. It is in the `template` folder.
* `style.css` points out the CSS code for styling to my deployment. It is in the `static/ css`folder.
* `entry.png` is the png file that I used as the background image of my API.
